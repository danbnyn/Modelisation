	abstract = {Oncolytic viruses are live, replication-competent viruses that replicate selectively in tumor cells leading to the destruction of the tumor cells. Tumor-selective replicating viruses offer appealing advantages over conventional cancer therapy and are promising a new approach for the treatment of human cancer. The development of virotherapeutics is based on several strategies. Virotherapy is not a new concept, but recent technical advances in the genetic modification of oncolytic viruses have improved their tumor specificity, leading to the development of new weapons for the war against cancer. Clinical trials with oncolytic viruses demonstrate the safety and feasibility of an effective virotherapeutic approach. Strategies to overcome potential obstacles and challenges to virotherapy are currently being explored. Systemic administrations of oncolytic viruses will successfully extend novel treatment against a range of tumors. Combination therapy has shown some encouraging antitumor responses by eliciting strong immunity against established cancer.},

	abstract = { Oncolytic virotherapy has currently emerged as a powerful therapeutic approach in cancer treatment. Although the history of using viruses goes back to the early 20th century, the approval of talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) in 2015 increased interest in oncolytic viruses (OVs). OVs are multifaceted biotherapeutic agents because they replicate in and kill tumor cells and augment immune responses by releasing immunostimulatory molecules from lysed cells. Despite promising results, some limitations hinder the efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy. The delivery challenges and the upregulation of checkpoints following oncolytic virotherapy also mediate resistance to OVs by diminishing immune responses. Furthermore, the localization of receptors of viruses in the tight junctions, interferon responses, and the aberrant expression of genes involved in the cell cycle of the virus, including their infection and replication, reduce the efficacy of OVs. In this review, we present different mechanisms of resistance to OVs and strategies to overcome them. },

@article{roy2021,
	abstract = {By conferring systemic protection and durable benefits, cancer immunotherapies are emerging as long-term solutions for cancer treatment. One such approach that is currently undergoing clinical testing is a therapeutic anti-cancer vaccine that uses two different viruses expressing the same tumor antigen to prime and boost anti-tumor immunity. By providing the additional advantage of directly killing cancer cells, oncolytic viruses (OVs) constitute ideal platforms for such treatment strategy. However, given that the targeted tumor antigen is encoded into the viral genomes, its production requires robust infection and therefore, the vaccination efficiency partially depends on the unpredictable and highly variable intrinsic sensitivity of each tumor to OV infection. In this study, we demonstrate that anti-cancer vaccination using OVs (Adenovirus (Ad), Maraba virus (MRB), Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Vaccinia virus (VV)) co-administered with antigenic peptides is as efficient as antigen-engineered OVs and does not depend on viral replication. Our strategy is particularly attractive for personalized anti-cancer vaccines targeting patient-specific mutations. We suggest that the use of OVs as adjuvant platforms for therapeutic anti-cancer vaccination warrants testing for cancer treatment.},
